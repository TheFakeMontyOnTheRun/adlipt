# ADLIPT

ADLIPT is a driver for the "Adlib on a parallel port" OPL2LPT board.
For more information, see [the thread on the Vogons forum][1].

## Usage

Load the TSR with the command:

    ADLIPT LPT1

assuming the OPL2LPT board is plugged into LPT1. It will use about
half a kilobyte of RAM. It can be loaded into high memory using the
DOS `LH` command.

Once loaded it cannot be unloaded, but it can be temporarily disabled
with the command:

    ADLIPT DISABLE

and re-enabled with:

    ADLIPT ENABLE

## Requirements

- 386 CPU
- EMM386 or QEMM
    - EMM386 version 4.46 or later (tested with version 4.49 from
      MS-DOS 6.22)
    - QEMM 7.03 or later (tested with QEMM 7.5)
    - Support for other memory managers could be added if there's
      interest.
- The OPL2LPT board ;)
